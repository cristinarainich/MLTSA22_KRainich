Team Members: Kristina Rainich, Jonathan Hicks, Dat Nguyen, Kopo Oromeng, Janina Boecher

KRainich: I was working on the code independently and compared the results with the rest of the team. Together with team members I understood what is the null (non-stationarity assumed) and alternative (stationarity assumed) hypotheses in AD fuller test. 

What was learned in this assignment: I learned how to effectively transfer data between kaggle, collab, and google drive; how to use merge function and make it work correctly; how to check whether data is stationary; finally, how to make this colorful heat map for correlation coefficients that are udes in every paper that I read.
