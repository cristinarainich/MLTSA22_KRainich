KRainich: I was working on the code independently and compared the results with the rest of the team. Together with Janina and Kopo, we understood how to use ARIMA models and tried to understand why there could be an error for some of the coefficients. At the end, you refered us in the right direction. Thank you! We also struggled a bit while understanding how different parameters correspond to parts of the models and what they mean.

What was learned in this assignment: I learned more about ARIMA models and what variations should be used for non-stationary vs. stationary time series. Also, how the choice of the parameters would influence the model and prediction.
