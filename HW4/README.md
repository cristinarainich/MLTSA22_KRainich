Team Members: Kristina Rainich, Jonathan Hicks, Dat Nguyen, Kopo Oromeng, Janina Boecher

KRainich: I was working on the code mostly independently and compared the results with the rest of the team. Together with Janina and with the help of Jonathan notes, we tried to understand the cross validation part works. Additionally, Janina helped me with final understanding of chi square formula and that the dates for extraction of weather data needs to be transformed using pd.to_date:) Finally, givel Colin's remarks in the chat about plotting the models' predictions, I also fixed those parts.

What was learned in this assignment: I learned how to make a complete additive model analysis of a time series and try to compare them
