Team Members: Kristina Rainich, Janina Boecher

KRainich: I was working on the code independently. Together with Janina, we compared the 'outliar' country in one of clusters and the variance scores that we got. I've also discussed with her whether I understood the concept of intra clusteral variance right.

What was learned in this assignment: I learned how to perform clustering analysis using k-means algorythm.
