KRainich: I was working on the code independently. Me and Janina discussed that some of the parts were conceptually difficult to grasp, however, we tried to do our best. 


What was learned in this assignment: I learned how to perform feature exctratction and gaussian processes, improved pandas skills. However, I still need to spend some more time on understanding the conceptual idea behind this algorithm and how to choose between the kernels.
