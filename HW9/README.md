Kristina: I worked on the notebook mostly independently with a heavy use of Google. Me, Ilya, and Janina discussed the step-by-step plan of what we should exactly do to do the HW, like first, import data, put in autoencoder, extract features, ect. Ilya also helped me understand when I should stop adding epochs for autoencoder. 

What I've learned: It was cool. The overall performance of the classifier could be better of course, but maybe by increasint the complexity of the autoencoder I could've achieved greater accuracy results in the classifier. Overall, it was really useful to go through all the steps from the very beginning to the wrapping up your data in the classifier.
